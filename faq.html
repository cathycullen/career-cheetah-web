                <div class="answer">
                <p> Career Cheetah is the revolutionary, fast and individualized way to discover your best career fit in just 3 weeks. It features our own proprietary career discovery process that we’ve developed, tested and successfully applied for over 18 years in more than 35,000 career coaching sessions. 
								Career Cheetah is currently available as an in-person bootcamp in the Chicago area and will soon have live streaming and self-paced online options as well. </p>

                <h3 class="question">What’s included?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                <p>The bootcamp consists of two full-day, in-person workshops, with a three-week, self-directed research period in between. Not to worry – we support you every step of the way. View the bootcamp section to learn more details. </p>

                <h3 class="question">What is expected of me?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                <p>This is an immersive process. You will need to commit to investing two full days in the Career Cheetah bootcamp, plus at least 10 hours of research during the three weeks in between.
                <br>
                <br>
                  The more thoughtful you are about the information you put in, the more you will get out. The more career research you do and the more career options you explore, the more confident you will feel that you are not “missing something.”</p>

                <div class="answer">
                  <p> 
                  No, we will provide everything you need, including paper, a pen, coffee, soft drinks, healthy snacks and lunch. We ask that you come well rested, with an open mind and ready for an adventure.

                <div class="answer">
                  <p> Visit our <a href="career-cheetah.html#schedule"> Bootcamp </a> Section for details about upcoming Career Cheetah bootcamps. </p>

                <h3 class="question">How does the sign-up process work?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>We limit each in-person bootcamp to 12 people to ensure that you receive personalized attention. We accept reservations for upcoming dates on a first-come, first-served basis. Please give serious thought to your schedule and preferences, as you must be available for both bootcamp days, as well as at least 10 hours of research time in between.
                    <br>
                    You will be asked for a non-refundable deposit of $250 when you register, to be applied to the full fee of $995. You will be charged the remaining balance exactly 2 weeks (14 days) before the first day of the bootcamp. When signing up less than 14 days beforehand, the full fee will be charged at the time of registration.

                <h3 class="question">What if:</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p><em>  I have absolutely no idea what I want to do? </em>
                  <br>Career Cheetah is very effective in helping you identify what’s most important to you in your career, consider and narrow down career options and, ultimately, determine the best career fit for you.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p><em>I have some idea of what I want to do, but don’t know how to move forward?</em>
                  <br>Through the Career Cheetah bootcamp, you will consider your career in new and important ways. The knowledge you gain about yourself from these exercises will help you evaluate the career ideas you currently have, as well as ones you may not have previously considered, and in the end, identify your best career path.</p>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>  <em>I know what I want to do, but I’m struggling to make a change? </em>
                  <br>In addition to our bootcamp, our expert career coaches can work with you to translate your goals into an action plan, helping you get motivated, move ahead and stay on track.</p>

              <li class="item">
                <h3 class="question">What if I have a learning disorder, acute anxiety or depression? Will it still work?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p> If you have challenges that might impact your participation or performance, please let us know before you sign up for the bootcamp. We will walk you through the process in more detail so you can decide if this is a good fit for you. We will also take additional time to help you identify and eliminate jobs that would not be a good fit, should they come up.
                  <br>For an additional fee, we offer our Career Cheetah: Mood Matters program, designed to address perceptual challenges – such as anxiety, fear, or depression – that often get in the way of a successful career transition. It is a 20-minute assessment followed by a three-hour debrief, facilitated by a licensed clinical social worker. 
                  <br>The Mood Matters program will help recalibrate your brain to become more aware of your thoughts, beliefs, moods and behaviors that hinder and sabotage your best self from getting the results you are after. It will help you significantly during your Career Cheetah process and provide beneficial tools and strategies that will last you a lifetime.

                <h3 class="question">Will you find me a job?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>No, we are not a job placement service. We’re here to help you identify the best career fit for you. We also offer a wide range of additional services to help you take the next steps toward landing your ideal job.

                <h3 class="question">What if I arrive late to the workshop?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                  <p>The exercises we guide you through build upon themselves throughout the process, so if you arrive late, you will not be able to participate. Because the workshops compress months of career fit exercises into two full days, we squeeze as much as we can into every minute and, therefore, we cannot make exceptions to this rule.

                <h3 class="question">What is the cancellation policy?</h3>
                <div class="answer">
                <p>Within 14 days of your first workshop date, you many transfer your reservation to a suitable substitute date within the following three months at no charge. Additional transfers are charged a $200 administration fee per transfer. The cancellation of any reservation within 14 days of your first workshop date will result in forfeiture of any fees.
                <br>You must complete the entire program within three months of your originally scheduled start date or forfeit all and any fees you have paid to Career Cheetah.
